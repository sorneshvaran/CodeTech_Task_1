# 🚀 Task 1: API Integration using Python

This repository contains my **Task 1** for the internship at **CodeTech**. The objective was to perform API integration using Python, extract real-time data, and display it meaningfully using `requests` and data processing libraries like `pandas`.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- To integrate a public API in Python.
- To fetch real-time or static data from the API endpoint.
- To process, clean, and present the data using Python tools.
- To build the foundation for real-world API-based projects.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- `Python 3.x`
- `requests`
- `pandas`
- `Jupyter Notebook`

---

## 📂 File Structure

```bash
📦 Task1_API_Integration
 ┣ 📄 Task1_API_Integration.ipynb
 ┗ 📄 README.md

---

## 📊 What This Project Does

* Sends a GET request to a public API endpoint.
* Parses the JSON response and converts it into a DataFrame.
* Cleans and filters the data.
* Displays final insights.

---

## 🧪 How to Run This Notebook

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Task1_API_Integration.git
   cd Task1_API_Integration
   ```

2. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Task1_API_Integration.ipynb
   ```

## 🔍 Output Snapshot

* ✅ Data successfully fetched from API
* ✅ Cleaned and structured using `pandas`
* ✅ Printed selected columns with meaningful insights

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This task helped me understand:

* The basics of API interaction in Python.
* How to handle JSON responses.
* The real-world applications of data processing using Python.
